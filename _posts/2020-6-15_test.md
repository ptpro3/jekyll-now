title: Feature Engineering Example: Apartment Listing Popularity
---
This dataset is part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries) hosted in conjunction with [renthop.com](https://www.renthop.com). The apartment listings are from their site, and the goal was to predict the popularity of a particular listing (High, Medium, or Low) based on a variety of features.
